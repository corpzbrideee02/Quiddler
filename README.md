## About Quiddler
Quiddler is a card game in which the players take turns making words using cards in their hand.

## Mechanics of tha Game:
A card contains either one or two letters along with its point value. 

The cards are dealt to the players from a deck and the number of cards in each player’s hand can vary between 3 and 10. 

The goal is to earn points and to ultimately “go out” by using all the cards in hand. 

Any subset of cards in hand may be used to form a word. 

A card can only be used once within a word. 

A word’s score is the sum of the points for each card.
